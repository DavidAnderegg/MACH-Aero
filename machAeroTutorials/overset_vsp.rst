Geometry generation with OpenVSP
########################

OpenVSP is a parametric airfcraft geometry tool. It allows the user to quickly generate aircraft geometries. 
We will use it to generate the ONERA M6 wing. This is not a full blown tutorial, more a walk through. If you 
want to learn more about it, you can go to their `tutorial videos <http://openvsp.org/vid_tutorial.shtml>`_
